# Cookies and Sessions Lab

## Learning Goals

- Use the session hash to persist data across multiple requests

## Introduction.

In this lab, you'll be building out a blog paywall feature by using the session
hash to keep track of how many page views a user has made.

There is some starter code in place for a Rails API backend and a React
frontend. To get set up, run:

```console
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate db:seed
$ npm install --prefix client
```

You can work on this lab by running the tests with `learn test`. It will also be
helpful to see what's happening during the request/response cycle by running the
app in the browser. You can run the Rails server with:

```console
$ rails s
```

And you can run React in another terminal with:

```console
$ npm start --prefix client
```

You don't have to make any changes to the React code to get this lab working.

## Instructions

Our app will keep track of how many blog posts a user has viewed by using the
`session` hash. Each user can view a **maximum of three articles** before seeing
the paywall.

When a user makes a `GET` request to `/articles/:id`, the following should
happen:

- If this is the first request this user has made, set `session[:page_views]` to
  an initial value of 0.
  - **Hint**: consider using `||=` to set this initial value!
- For every request to `/articles/:id`, increment the value of
  `session[:page_views]` by 1.
- If the user has viewed 3 or fewer pages, render a JSON response with the
  article data.
- If the user has viewed more than 3 pages, render a JSON response including an
  error message, and a status code of 401 unauthorized.
